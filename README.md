# Rhythm

[This project is now closed and (probably?) won't be ever continued.]

The idea was to create an app that can make personal schedules based on person's circadian rhythms.

## Technologies

Frontend: Angular2

Backend: NodeJS, MongoDB, Express

## How to run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
